FortiusAnt exchanges data between USB or ANT+ Tacx trainer with an ANT+ or BLE
Cycling Training Program

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a                    Automatically start; “Locate HW” and “Start” if the
                        required devices were found.
  -A                    Pedal Stroke Analysis.
  -b                    Advertise FortiusAnt as “FortiusAnt Trainer” on a
                        Bluetooth Low Energy dongle.
  -B 0...65535          ANT DeviceNumber range Base, making multiple
                        FortiusAnt sessions unique.
  -c 0...100            Calibrate the rolling resistance for magnetic brake.
  -d 0...255            Create logfile with debugging data.
  -D USB-DeviceID       Select one specific antDongle (perhaps with a non-
                        standard deviceID).
  -e                    Operate as homeTrainer (excersize bike); up/down
                        increments/decrements power with 10%.
  -g                    Run with graphical user interface.
  -G % / % / %          Modify the requested grade with a
                        factor/factorDownhill.
  -H ANT+DeviceID       Pair this Heart Rate Monitor (0: any, -1: none). Tacx
                        HRM is used if not specified.
  -i                    Imperial, speed in mph.
  -l                    Display status leds.
  -m                    Run manual power (ignore target from ANT+ Dongle).
  -M                    Run manual grade (ignore target from ANT+ Dongle).
  -n                    Do not calibrate before start.
  -p %                  Adjust target Power by multiplying by this factor for
                        static calibration.
  -P                    Power mode has preference over Resistance mode (for 30
                        seconds).
  -r                    Target Resistance = Target Power (to create power
                        curve).
  -R see text           The runoff procedure can be customized:
                        maxSpeed/dip/minSpeed/targetTime/power.
  -s                    Simulate trainer to test ANT+ connectivity.

  -t {Bushido,Genius,Vortex,Magneticbrake,Motorbrake,i-Vortex}
                        Specify Tacx Type; if not specified, USB-trainers will
                        be detected automatically.
  -x                    Export TCX file to upload into Strava, Sporttracks,
                        Training peaks.
