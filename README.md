# FortiusANT
FortiusANT enables a pre-smart Tacx trainer (usb- or ANT-connected) to communicate with TrainerRoad, Rouvy or Zwift through ANT.

FortiusANT is running on the computer (Windows, Linux or MacOS) where the trainer is connected and broadcasts the ANT+ signal, using a dongle, to another computer or tablet.
You might also run TrainerRoad or Zwift on the same computer and then two ANT+ dongles on the same computer are required.

## Supported tacx trainers
USB: Tacx Flow, Fortius, i-Flow, i-Flow, i-Magic with T1902, T1904, T1932, T1942 head units

ANT: i-Vortex

## Communication with Trainer Road, Rouvy, Zwift and others
Communication with a Cycling Training Program (CTP) can be done using an ANT- or BLE-dongle (BLE = Bluetooth Low Energy)

The CTP can be run on another computer or Smartphone.
