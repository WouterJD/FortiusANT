// This version uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
// Semver uses the following format: major.minor.patch-tag
// where:
// - major: increases when there are backwards incompatible changes, e.g. http endpoints are
//          removed or data is removed from an endpoint.
//          A major version of 0 indicates the APIs are not stable yet, the interfaces may still change
//          Once the interface is settled the major version can be changed to 1, indicating the interface is stable.
// - minor: increases when there are new features added that are backwards compatible
// - patch: increases when a bug has been fixed, but no new features are added.
// - tag:   an optional field that may indicate a pre-release version, e.g. rc1 (release candidate 1).
